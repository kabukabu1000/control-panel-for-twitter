## Releases / What's New?

The [Control Panel for Twitter Releases page](https://github.com/insin/control-panel-for-twitter/releases) highlights new features, changes and fixes in each version, and shows which version is currently published on each of the browser extension stores.

New versions can take anything from minutes to days to be approved for publishing after they're submitted to a browser extension store.

### UI tweaks

- Disable use of the Chirp font if you don't like it
- Disable bold and italic text in tweets
- Use the site's normal text font style in the primary navigation menu on desktop to make it less distracting
- Change the navigation menu density on desktop to make it take less room
- Use normal font weight in dropdown menus - if everything's bold, nothing's bold
- Uninvert the Follow and Following buttons to make them less jarring
  - Choice of monochrome or themed (classic) styling for uninverted buttons

### Remove algorithmic content

- Hide "Discover more" algorithmic tweets when viewing a tweet

### Reduce "engagement"

- Hide metrics
- Reduced interaction mode: hide the action bar under tweets – replies are now the only means of interacting
- Disable the home timeline: find yourself [wasting too much time on Twitter](https://world.hey.com/brecht/free-range-tweet-farming-9399f6e5)? Try preventing use of the home timeline, going to Notifications or Messages by default instead
